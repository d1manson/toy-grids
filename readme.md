You can view the thing live at (d1manson.github.io/toy-grids)[http://d1manson.github.io/toy-grids].  There's a small amount of explanation on that page.

### developing
Everything is JavaScript/HTML5, but it makes heavy use of [Polymer 1.0](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/), and the vulcanize tool, plus you probably need Bower....which is to say that you're going to need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org).  And you'll need something (like Python, although I beleive you can also use nodejs) to run a localhost server (I have python and simply use the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5103`).
